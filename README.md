Run the Spring Boot project using JDK 8
- run npm install for the first time
- enable Annotation processing
- the app can be loaded at localhost:8080 or configure a different port server.port= in application.properties
- or use the Maven package task to generate a jar artifact and execute the command via java -jar target/agendaeditor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar for ex.
- feel free to migrate the project to a different tech stack that you are more comfortable with
